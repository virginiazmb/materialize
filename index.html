        <h1>THE GALAXY WE KNOW...</h1>
        <p>Galaxies are sprawling systems of dust, gas, dark matter, and anywhere from a million to a trillion stars that are held together by gravity. Nearly all large galaxies are thought to also contain supermassive black holes at their centers. In our own galaxy, the Milky Way, the sun is just one of about 100 to 400 billion stars that spin around Sagittarius A*, a supermassive black hole that contains as much mass as four million suns.</p>

        <h2>STARS IN OUR UNIVERSE</h2>
        <img src="./img/stars.avif" alt="" class="img">
        <p class="parrafo">Looking up into the night sky, you might wonder just how many stars are in the universe. It's challenging enough for an amateur astronomer to count the number of naked-eye stars that are visible and, with bigger telescopes, more stars become visible, making counting a lengthy process. So how do astronomers figure out how many stars are in the universe?</p>
        <p class="parrafo">The simplest answer may be to estimate the number of stars in a typical galaxy, and then multiply that by the estimated number of galaxies in the universe, according to the European Space Agency (ESA)(opens in new tab). But even that is tricky, as some galaxies shine better in visible or some in infrared, for example. There also are estimation hurdles that must be overcome.</p>
        <img src="./img/screen-shot-2020-04-10-at-3-02-09-pm-1586545347.png" alt="" class="imag">
        <p class="pa">In October 2016, deep-field images from the Hubble Space Telescope suggested that there are about 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe, or about 10 times more galaxies than previously suggested, according to the journal Nature(opens in new tab). In an email with Live Science, lead author Christopher Conselice, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom, said there were about 100 million stars in the average galaxy. </p>
        <p class="parr">Telescopes may not be able to view all the stars in a galaxy, however. A 2008 estimate by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey found about 48 million stars, roughly half of what astronomers expected to see. A star like our own sun may not even show up in such a catalog. So, many astronomers estimate the number of stars in a galaxy based on its mass.</p>
